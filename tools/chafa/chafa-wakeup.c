 * @title: ChafaWakeup
 * @short_description: portable cross-thread event signal mechanism
 *
 * #ChafaWakeup is a simple and portable way of signaling events between
 * different threads in a way that integrates nicely with g_poll().
 * GLib uses it internally for cross-thread signalling in the
 * implementation of #GMainContext and #GCancellable.
 *
 * You first create a #ChafaWakeup with chafa_wakeup_new() and initialise a
 * #GPollFD from it using chafa_wakeup_get_pollfd().  Polling on the created
 * #GPollFD will block until chafa_wakeup_signal() is called, at which point
 * it will immediately return.  Future attempts to poll will continue to
 * return until chafa_wakeup_acknowledge() is called.  chafa_wakeup_free() is
 * used to free a #ChafaWakeup.
 *
 * On sufficiently modern Linux, this is implemented using eventfd.  On
 * Windows it is implemented using an event handle.  On other systems it
 * is implemented with a pair of pipes.
 *
 * Since: 2.30
